## 🌟 Why uLearn?
During our final year at university, we observed a significant disparity in students' access to quality study materials. While some excelled with well-organized resources, others struggled due to limited access. This inspired us to build **uLearn**, a platform where students can seamlessly share resources, collaborate, and enhance their learning experience.
